## Fundamental Equations in MHD and EHD

### 1. Navier-Stokes Equation with Lorentz Force (MHD)

The Navier-Stokes equation for fluid motion with the Lorentz force is given by:

$$
\rho \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{v} \right) = -\nabla p + \eta \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B}
$$

where:
- $\rho$: Fluid density
- $\mathbf{v}$: Velocity field of the fluid
- $p$: Pressure
- $\eta$: Dynamic viscosity
- $\mathbf{J}$: Current density
- $\mathbf{B}$: Magnetic field

The term $\mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B}$ represents the Lorentz force acting on the fluid.

### 2. Magnetic Induction Equation (MHD)

The magnetic induction equation describes how the magnetic field in a conductive fluid evolves over time:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = \nabla \times (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}) + \eta_m \nabla^2 \mathbf{B}
$$

where $\eta_m = \frac{1}{\mu \sigma}$ is the magnetic diffusivity of the fluid, with:
- $\sigma$: Electrical conductivity
- $\mu$: Magnetic permeability

This equation shows the interplay between fluid motion and magnetic field distribution.

### 3. Continuity Equation for Mass Conservation

The continuity equation ensures mass conservation in the fluid:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0
$$

where $\rho$ is the fluid density and $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity field.

### 4. Ohm’s Law for EHD

In EHD, Ohm's law links the electric field, magnetic field, and current density in the fluid:

$$
\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} = \eta \mathbf{J}
$$

where $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field and $\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}$ represents the electromotive force.

### 5. Gauss’s Law for Magnetism

Gauss’s law states that magnetic monopoles do not exist, and magnetic flux through a closed surface is zero:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0
$$

This implies that magnetic field lines form closed loops.

## Practical Calculations

### Example: Lorentz Force on a Conductive Fluid (MHD)

For a conductive fluid, the Lorentz force $\mathbf{F}$ acting on the fluid can be expressed as:

$$
\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B}
$$

where $\mathbf{J}$ is the current density and $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field strength.

### Electric Force in EHD

In EHD systems, the electric force $\mathbf{F}_e$ on a fluid with charge density $\rho_e$ in an electric field $\mathbf{E}$ is:

$$
\mathbf{F}_e = \rho_e \mathbf{E}
$$

where $\rho_e$ is the electric charge density.

## Key Parameters

### 1. Magnetic Field Strength

For an electromagnet with current $I$, the magnetic field strength $B$ at a distance $r$ from the wire can be calculated by:

$$
B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi r}
$$

where $\mu_0$ is the magnetic permeability of free space.

### 2. Electric Field Strength (EHD)

For parallel-plate electrodes with voltage $V$ and separation $d$, the electric field strength $E$ is:

$$
E = \frac{V}{d}
$$

This relationship is essential for determining field strength in EHD systems.
