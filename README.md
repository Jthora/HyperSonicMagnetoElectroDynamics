Here’s a structured list of equation categories and sub-categories relevant for studying neural networks, cognitive modeling, and theories of consciousness:

1. Foundational Equations in Neural Networks

	•	Activation Functions
	•	Sigmoid:  \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} 
	•	Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent):  \text{tanh}(x) = \frac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{e^{x} + e^{-x}} 
	•	ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):  f(x) = \max(0, x) 
	•	Softmax:  \text{softmax}(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{j} e^{x_j}} 
	•	Loss Functions
	•	Mean Squared Error (MSE):  \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2 
	•	Cross-Entropy Loss:  L = -\sum_i y_i \log(\hat{y_i}) 
	•	KL Divergence:  D_{KL}(P||Q) = \sum_i P(i) \log \frac{P(i)}{Q(i)} 
	•	Optimization Algorithms
	•	Gradient Descent:  w := w - \eta \nabla_w L(w) 
	•	Adam Optimizer: Combination of momentum and RMSProp for adaptive learning rates.

2. Network Architectures and Memory Equations

	•	Feedforward Networks
	•	Forward Propagation:  a^{(l+1)} = f(W^{(l)}a^{(l)} + b^{(l)}) 
	•	Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
	•	Simple RNN Cell:  h_t = f(W_x x_t + W_h h_{t-1} + b) 
	•	LSTM Cell
	•	Forget Gate:  f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f) 
	•	Input Gate:  i_t = \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i) 
	•	Output Gate:  o_t = \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o) 
	•	Hopfield Networks
	•	Energy Function:  E = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i} \sum_{j} w_{ij} s_i s_j + \sum_{i} \theta_i s_i 
	•	Boltzmann Machines
	•	Energy Function:  E = - \sum_{i} a_i s_i - \sum_{i < j} w_{ij} s_i s_j 

3. Attention and Consciousness Modeling Equations

	•	Attention Mechanisms
	•	Scaled Dot-Product Attention:
 \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V 
	•	Transformer Models
	•	Self-Attention: Each token attends to every other token in the input.
	•	Global Workspace Theory Equations
	•	Global Neuronal Workspace Activation: Modeled as weighted summations across neuron layers, representing conscious awareness activation through recurrent loops.

4. Probabilistic and Cognitive Modeling Equations

	•	Markov Chains
	•	Transition Matrix:  P(X_{t+1} = j | X_t = i) = p_{ij} 
	•	Bayesian Inference Models
	•	Posterior Probability:  P(\theta | X) = \frac{P(X | \theta)P(\theta)}{P(X)} 
	•	Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)
	•	Free Energy:  F(v) = - \sum_{i} a_i v_i - \sum_j \log\left(1 + \exp(b_j + \sum_i v_i w_{ij})\right) 

5. Equations for Modeling Memory and Consciousness

	•	Hebbian Learning Rule
	•	Weight Update:  \Delta w_{ij} = \eta \, x_i \, y_j 
	•	Attractor Dynamics (Used in Memory and Consciousness Models)
	•	Lyapunov Stability Equations for determining stable points or “attractors” in neural systems, where  \dot{x} = f(x)  shows points of stability.
	•	Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
	•	Φ Calculation: Measures integration across information channels.

6. Emergent Properties and Qualia Representation Equations

	•	Graph Theory for Network Consciousness
	•	Graph Centrality Measures: Calculations for node importance, like Eigenvector centrality, help in defining hubs of conscious awareness.
	•	Information Flow (Entropy):  H(X) = -\sum p(x) \log(p(x)) 
	•	Quantum Neural Networks
	•	Superposition State Representation: Extends neural states to qubits, where states are  |\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle 
	•	Qualia and Information Representation
	•	Information Partitioning in networks, measuring qualia as complex, stable patterns in high-dimensional space.

These categories and sub-categories offer a comprehensive map of equations and concepts relevant to neural networks, mind models, and consciousness research. Each provides a layer of insight into how neural computations can model increasingly complex cognitive phenomena.
